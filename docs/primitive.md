<h4>#Primitive Data Types</h4>

<p>Primitive data types are those unable to decomposed into simpler values. 
These are programming languages built in data types. Different programming 
languages have different built in data types in their intend application area.
May your mind knock in some point that what are these types. In programming language,
data types  are set of values of same type. Logically when you declaring a character variable, you must
have to select the specific character value of languages specific character set.

<p style="display:inline;">C Support a few primitve data types. For Instance - 
<h5>		# Character - to represent ASCCI Character set</h5>
<h5>		# Integer - to represent integer values</h5>
<h5>		# Real Number - to represent real number</h5>
</p></hr></hr>

<code>
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
	// c is strictly typed language, so variable and valus must be same type
	char ch = 'M';  // char to represent character
	printf("Character: %c\n", ch);
	
	int integer = 100;  // int to represent numeric values
	printf("Integer: %d\n", integer);
	
	float flt = 10.22;  // float to represent real number
	printf("Real Number: %f\n", flt); 
	return 0;
}
