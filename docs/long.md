<h4>#Type Modifiers</h4>

<p>Type modifiers are to alter the default behaviour of data types.</p>

<h4>#Signed</h4>
<p>To reprsent negative number, C use two complement's number system. You might imagine what is this two complement's number system. In bit string, the high order bit is interpreted as a sign flag. If the HO bit is 1, then the number interpreted as negative and respectively 0 as positive.</p>

<h5>	#Integer Signed</h4>
<p>		Integer is by default signed. So preceding the signed before int data type is redundant. In 32bit, we can represent 65536 different numeric values. But in two complement number system, we can represent -32768...32767 different values. Because the HO bit is used as sign bit.</p>
