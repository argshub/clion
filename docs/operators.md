<h4>#Operators</h4>

<p>Operators are used in programming languages to do some specific task. For instance- to do some arithmetic operation we need some operator likely addition(+), subtraction(-) etc. In C,  There's a rich collection of built in operators.</p>
<code>
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) {
	int x, y;
	x =  10;      // =(assignment operator) to assign a value to a variable 
	y = 20;
	x = x + y;    // +(addition operator) to add two numbers
	printf("after addition: %d\n", x);
	return 0;
}
</code>
